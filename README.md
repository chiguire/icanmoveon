I Can Move On
=============

An interactive poem written by Yole Quintero, and made physical game by Yole Quintero and Ciro Duran.

This document describes what you will find in this repo, and how can you rebuild and run the game.

## I Can Move On

A storm passed a few days ago  
It took my house, leaving me unprotected  
The sky is grey, there’s no trees  
It’s just me standing, revealed

I’m trying to find the last piece of a puzzle  
The one that will help me to move on  
I think I found it, the storm brought it to me  
It took everything else, but gave me that little piece

Yes, I don’t have a house  
But at least I know I can move on

## Requirements

This game requires to build a cardboard device, some game pieces, and some circuitry.

This game also requires an Arduino (we used an Arduino Mega, but it could be an Arduino UNO), a [https://www.adafruit.com/product/2026](32x32 RGB Adafruit Matrix screen), and kitchen foil for closing the circuits.

## This repo

* The r_and_d directory contains sketches we wrote to test the individual parts that make up the game. They are not essential to run it.
* The icanmoveon directory contains the Arduino Mega sketch that powers the game.
